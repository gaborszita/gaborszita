# Hi, I'm Gabor Szita! üëã

I am a first-year Computer Science student at UC Santa Barbara. I am interested in gaining research experience, so please feel free to contact me if you're looking for an undergraduate student to assist with your research!

## About Me

- Research Experience: I took the **Advanced Scientific Investigation** class at Los Altos High School and I did research on how to improve the accuracy of **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**.
    - Built a robot equipped with a **LIDAR**, a gyro sensor, a reflectance sensor, and a camera for **AprilTag detecion**.
    - **Improved localization accuracy** by combining data from multiple sensors.
    - üèÜ Presented my project at the **SYNOPSYS Science Fair**, earning **two awards**.

- Robotics Experience: At Los Altos High School, I was a member of the school's FIRST Robotics Competition team, **Team 114 EagleStrike**.
  - Year 1: I learned **control systems**, like PID and feedforward, and contributed to the robot‚Äôs double-jointed arm control.
  - Year 2: I worked on the team‚Äôs **scouting app**, which we use to collect data about robots at competitions. I was the **head of backend systems and privacy**.
