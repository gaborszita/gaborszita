Hi!

I am Gabor Szita, a first-year Computer Science student at UC Santa Barbara. I am interested in gaining research experience, so please feel free to contact me if you're looking for an undergraduate student to assist with your research!

I went to Los Altos High School in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was a member of the high school’s FIRST Robotics Competition team, Team 114 EagleStrike. During my first year at the team I learned about control systems, like PID and feedforward. The second year I worked on the team’s scouting app, which we use to collect data about other robots. Our team achieved outstanding results at competitions. In 2024, we placed first in the San Francisco Regional Competition, second in the Idaho Regional Competition, and qualified for the Houston Championship.

During my time at Los Altos High School, I also took the Advanced Scientific Investigation class. In this class, I did research on how to improve the accuracy of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). I presented my project at the SYNOPSYS Science Fair and received two awards.
